<h4>Unsupervised Machine Learning on ZTF light curves</h4>
<p>
  The research was on developing and testing a methodology for using unsupervised machine learning to mine ZTF light curves for rare, anomalous sources, new classes of transient and hidden relationships previously undiscovered in the data 
  along with understanding the physical processes that drive those relationships.
