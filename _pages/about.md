Hello, my name is Avi Patel. I'm a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. My interests include anomaly detection in time-series data, deep learning, data mining and visualization. My research is using machine learning to detect and characterize variable stars. 

I received a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the California Institute of Technology and Bachelor of Science in Physics from Haverford College. 

Aside from research, I am an avid mountain biker and enjoy playing guitar and composing music. 

Feel free to reach out to me via email linked below. 


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
