The ME/EE/CS 133a course is the first in the core robotics sequence at Caltech focusing on kinematics and dynamics of robotic systems. 
For our final project, we evaluated the performance of the Boston Dynamics Atlas robot cutting with the right hand and reaching 
to grab an item on a neighboring shelf with the left. We approached this problem in two ways: First, we defined the cutting motion of the 
right arm as the primary task and the left hand as the secondary task. Second, we defined both the right 
and left hand tasks as primary tasks. We described our results including the tradeoffs between both approaches in our final report and video.
